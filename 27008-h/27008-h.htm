<h3>NOTES ON GRAMMONT.</h3>

  <p>Agreeing with Mr. Peter Cunningham (vide <i>History of Nell Gwyn</i>),
  that a new edition of Grammont is much wanted, I beg to avail myself of
  your pages, and to offer a few remarks and notes which I have made in
  reference to that very entertaining work for the consideration of a
  future annotator.</p>

  <p>Of the several maids of honour mentioned therein I will begin with
  those of the queen. They are Miss Stewart, Miss "Warminster," Miss
  Bellenden, Miss Bardon, Miss de la Garde, Miss Wells, Miss Livingston,
  Miss Fielding, and Miss Boynton.</p>

  <p>The names of Miss Stewart (Frances Theresa), Miss Boynton (Catherine),
  Miss Wells (Winefred), and Miss Warmistre are found among the original
  six, appointed on the queen's marriage, May 21, 1662. The affiliation and
  marriages of the first two have been well ascertained, but Miss
  Warmistre's birth is yet open to some conjecture, whilst her marriage,
  like Miss Wells's parentage, is wholly unknown.</p>

  <p>Horace Walpole, on the authority of the last Earl of Arran, of the
  Butler family, has confounded her with Mary, one of the daughters of
  George Kirke, Esq., a groom of the bedchamber to Charles I., by Mary his
  wife, daughter of Aurelian Townsend, Esq., "the admired beauty of the
  tymes," on whose marriage at Christ Church, Oxford, February 26, 1645-6,
  "the king gave her." She herself was maid of honour to the Duchess of
  York in 1674, and the year following left the court, we may believe,
  under the same circumstances as Miss Warmistre, more than ten years
  before, had quitted it: after being the mistress of Sir Thomas Vernon,
  the second Baronet of Hodnet in Shropshire, she became his wife, and
  ended her life in miserable circumstances at Greenwich in 1711.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"1711, 17 August, Dame Mary, relict of Sir Thomas Vernon, carried
  away."&mdash;Burial register of Greenwich Church.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>She was sister to Diana, the last De Vere, Earl of Oxford's, countess,
  a lady of as free a morality <!-- Page 462 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page462"></a>{462}</span>as herself and as her mother, and second
  wife of Sir Thomas, whose first lady, Elizabeth Cholmondley, died in
  June, 1676. Sir Thomas died February 5, 1682-3, leaving by her three
  children, Sir Richard, the last baronet, Henrietta, and Diana, who all
  died unmarried.</p>

  <p>A portrait of Lady Vernon, by Sir Peter Lely, has been engraved in
  mezzotinto by Browne, and lettered "Mary Kirk, Lady Vernon, maid of
  honour to Queen Catherine." Another portrait (?) has been engraved by
  Scheneker for Harding's <i>Grammont</i>, 1793. A third portrait was
  purchased at the Strawberry Hill sale, by Mr. Rodd of Little Newport
  Street, for 1<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i></p>

  <p>A portrait of the Countess of Oxford is or was at Mr. Drummond's of
  Great Stanmore. It was bequeathed to his family by Charles, first Duke of
  St. Alban's, who was her ladyship's son-in-law.</p>

  <p>Of Mrs. Anne Kirke, who was "woman to the queen" Henrietta Maria,
  there are several portraits. Granger records:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Madam Kirk. Vandyck p. Gaywood f. h. sh.</p>

  <p>"Madam Anne Kirk. Vandyck p. Browne, large h. sh. mezz."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>These engravings are most probably from the same painting&mdash;the
  fine whole-length exhibited last year among the collection of pictures by
  ancient masters in Pall Mall:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Madam Kirk, sitting in a chair, Hollar, f. h. sh."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He also mentions her miniature at Burghley.</p>

  <p>There is at Wilton a splendid painting by Vandyck of Mrs. Kirk, seated
  with the Countess of Morton, Lady Anne Keith, eldest daughter of George,
  fifth Earl Mareschal, and wife of William Douglass, seventh Earl of
  Morton, K.G. She was governess to the Princess Henrietta.</p>

  <p>This painting has been engraved by Grousvelt. There is another
  engraving from the first-named Vandyck by Beckett.</p>

  <p>Of Lady Vernon and her mother there is to be found mention, in the
  secret service expenses of Charles II. and James II., lately printed. The
  elder lady on her husband's death (he was buried in the cloisters of
  Westminster Abbey, April 5, 1679) seems to have had a pension of
  250<i>l.</i> per annum. The younger was the recipient, on two occasions,
  of 100<i>l.</i> "bounty" only.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Kirke and her daughter Diana are unfavourably alluded to by Mrs.
  Grace Worthley, a lady of the same class, who will not "be any longer a
  laughing-stock for any of Mr. Kirk's bastards" (vide letter to her cousin
  Lord Brandon, September 7, 1682, <i>Diary of Henry Sidney, Earl of
  Romney</i>, i. pp. xxxiii. xxxiv.). And again, the same lady, in another
  letter, speaks of "the common Countess of Oxford and her adulterous
  bastards" (<i>Ibid.</i>). Mr. Jesse's quotation from "Queries and Answers
  from Garraway's Coffee House" (vide <i>The Court of the Stewarts</i>,
  vol. ii. p. 366.) may be here reproduced in support of the epitaph which

  <p>It is not certain whether it is to "Mistris Kirke," Lady Vernon's
  mother, that Charles I. refers in his letter addressed to Colonel Whaley
  on the day of his escape from Hampton Court, November 11, 1647, but it is
  very likely to have been so. There was a Mistress (Anne) Kirke, sworn in
  a dresser to Queen Henrietta Maria in Easter week, 1637 (vide
  <i>Strafford Papers</i>, vol. ii. p. 73.), whose full-length portrait by
  Vandyke has been frequently engraved, by Browne, Garwood, Hollar,
  Beckett, &amp;c.; and this lady may be the "Mrs. Anne Kirke,
  unfortunately drowned near London Bridge," who was buried in Westminster
  Abbey, July 9, 1641. <!-- Page 463 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page463"></a>{463}</span></p>

  <p>In Westminster Abbey was buried, May 23, 1640, "Mr. Kirk's daughter."
  Captain George Kirke married there, February 10, 1699-1700, Mary Cooke.
  George Kirke, Esq., died Jan. 10, 1703-4, and was buried in the abbey
  cloisters (Mon. Inscr.); and Mrs. Mary Kirke died December 17, 1751, and
  was also buried there (M.&nbsp;I.). We may presume that all these Kirkes were
  of the same family.</p>

  <p>Having now clearly released the annotator from all farther
  interference with Mary Kirke's private history, and having excluded her
  handsome face from any future illustrated edition of Grammont, I must
  leave him to deal with Miss Warmistre. It seems most probable that Dr.
  Thomas Warmistre, dean of Worcester, who died October 30, 1665, was her
  father, as he is known to have been a Royalist. His will, as it is not to
  be found at Doctors' Commons, must be sought for at Worcester. His
  brother Gervais was a married man, but his effects, unfortunately for our
  inquiries, were administered to at Doctors' Commons, August 31, 1641.
  That Warmistre was her right name is proved by Lord Cornbury's letter to
  the Duchess of Bedford, June 10, 1662 (Warburton's <i>Rupert</i>, vol.
  iii. pp. 461-464.). Her portrait is at Hengrave Hall, Suffolk, and has
  been engraved by Scriven for Carpenter's <i>Grammont</i>, 1811.</p>

  <p>Lord Cornbury's letter contradicts Grammont's statement, that Miss
  Boynton and Miss Wells came in on a removal, for they were of the
  original six maids of honour. Among these is named a Miss Price
  (Henrietta Maria), who we may suppose a sister to the Duchess of York's
  Miss Price, one of Grammont's most conspicuous heroines; and if so, when
  I come to speak of the Duchess's maids of honour, her parentage will be
  proved. Of Miss Carey, rejoicing in the prefix of Simona, the sixth of
  the queen's original maids of honour, we have no farther occasion to
  speak.</p>

  <p>In 1669 the queen appears to have had four maids of honour only, the
  places vacated by Miss Stewart's and Miss Warmistre's marriages being
  unoccupied. This state of affairs leads me to doubt whether Miss
  Bellenden ever held the appointment. Mademoiselle Bardon, Grammont
  admits, was not actually a maid of honour, and Mademoiselle de la Garde
  certainly never was. <span class="sc">Lord Braybrooke</span> has
  suggested to me, with some show of reason, that the first may be the
  "Mrs. Baladine" who held a place of less emolument (that of dresser,
  probably) in the Duchess of York's household, and who left in the middle
  of the quarter, between Michaelmas and Christmas, 1662 (vide <i>Household
  Book of James Duke of York at Audley End</i>), as if she had the prudence
  "de quitter la cour avant que d'en être chassée."</p>

  <p>"La désagréable Bardon" may have been a daughter, or some other near
  relation, to Claudius Bardon, mentioned in the secret service expenses of
  Charles II.</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle de la Garde was appointed a dresser to the queen on her
  marriage (vide Lord Cornbury's letter), and continued in this office till
  1673, when she died. Her father, Charles Peliott Baron de la Garde, or
  her brother, if she had one, was a groom of the privy chamber to Queen
  Catherine in 1687, and her mother dresser to the Duchess of York in 1662
  (<i>Duke of York's Household Book</i>). Mary her sister, who became the
  wife of Sir Thomas Bond of Peckham, co. Surrey, Baronet, comptroller of
  the household to Queen Henrietta Maria, was a Lady of the privy chamber
  to the same queen.</p>

  <p>Of mademoiselle I may add, that she married Mr. Gabriel Silvius,
  carver to the queen, in 1669 (compare first and second editions of
  <i>Angliæ Notitia</i>, 1669); and of her husband, in addition to the
  particulars already stated by the annotators, that he received the honour
  of knighthood January 28, 1669-70, married a second wife (a fact
  overlooked by the annotators, including Mr. Cunningham), viz. Anne,
  daughter of the Hon. William Howard, a younger son of Thomas first Earl
  of Berkshire, at Westminster Abbey, November 12, 1677, went the same year
  to the Hague as master of the household to the Prince of Orange (Evelyn),
  became privy purse to James II. (<i>The British Compendium, or Rudiments
  of Honour</i>), died at his house in Leicester Fields, January, 1696-7,
  and was buried in the church of St. Martin. It was his second wife, and
  widow, who died October 13, 1730.</p>

  <p>If, as it is possible, Miss Bellenden did hold the appointment of maid
  of honour to the queen, she must have replaced Miss Stewart or Miss
  Warmistre; and if Miss Livingston and Miss Fielding held like
  appointments, one of the two must have replaced her, and they, again,
  must have removed from the court before 1669. I am not at present able to
  say who those three ladies were.</p>

  <p>Before bringing this paper to a conclusion, I must be permitted to
  refer Mr. Cunningham to five letters, written by Count de Comminges, the
  French ambassador in London, and printed <span class="sc">Lord
  Braybrooke</span> in his Appendix to Pepys, which Mr. C. has very
  unaccountably overlooked when settling the chronology of Grammont.</p>

  <p>The first, to M. de Lionne, dated "Londres, Janvier 5-15, 1662-3,"
  announces the arrival of the Chevalier the day before "fort content de
  son voyage. Il a été ici reçu le plus agréablement au monde. Il est de
  toutes les parties du Roi." The second, to Louis XIV., dated "Décembre
  10-20, 1663," informs the king of the chevalier's joy at being allowed to
  return to France, and of his intention to leave England in four days. He
  also informs Louis that he believes the chevalier will see the court of
  France in company of "une belle <!-- Page 464 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page464"></a>{464}</span>Angloise." A postscript, dated "Décembre
  20-24," says that the king of England, for certain stated reasons, has
  persuaded the chevalier to remain a day longer; and, farther, "Il laisse
  ici quelques autres dettes, qu'il prétend venir recueillir quand il se
  déclarera sur le sujet de Mille Hamilton, qui est si embrouillé que les
  plus clairvoyans n'y voyent goutte." The third, dated "Mai 19-24, 1664,"
  is also to the King of France, and speaks of the Chevalier's wife,
  "madame sa femme." The next letter is addressed to M. de Lionne, and
  dated "Aout 29, Septembre 8, 1664." It contains this important
  intelligence: "Madam la Comtesse de Grammont accoucha hier au soir d'un
  fils beau comme la mère, et galant comme le père." The last letter, dated
  "Octobre 24, Novembre 3, 1664," and addressed to the same M. de Lionne,
  commences as follows: "Le Comte de Grammont est parti aujourd'hui avec sa
  femme."</p>

  <p>These several letters, all important to the annotators of Grammont,
  give the precise dates of the chevalier's first visit to the Court of
  Charles II., and of his departure, and settle the date of his marriage
  within a few days. This event must have taken place in December, 1663.
  Mrs. Jameson and Mr. Cunningham place it in 1668.</p>

<h3>CHANGE OF MEANING IN PROVERBIAL EXPRESSIONS.</h3>

  <p>I entirely agree with G. K. (Vol. viii., p. 269.) respecting the
  original sense of "Putting a spoke in one's wheel." It surely meant to
  aid him in constructing the wheel, say of his fortune. As the true sense
  of this expression seems to have been retained in America when lost in
  its birthplace, so Ireland has retained that of another which has changed
  its sense here. By "finding a mare's nest" is, I believe, meant, fancying
  you have made a great discovery when in fact you have found nothing. I
  certainly remember the late Earl Grey using it in that sense in his place
  in parliament. But how does this accord with the following place in
  Beaumont and Fletcher?</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4hg3">"Why dost thou laugh?</p>
      <p>What mare's nest hast thou found?"&mdash;<i>Bonduca</i>, Act V. Sc. 2.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>on which, rather to my surprise, Mr. Dyce has no note. Now in Ireland,
  when a person is seen laughing immoderately without any apparent cause,
  it is usual to say, "O, he has found a mare's nest, and he's laughing at
  the eggs." This perfectly agrees with the above passage from
  <i>Bonduca</i>, and is doubtless the original sense and original form of
  the adage.</p>

  <p>There is another of these proverbial expressions which, I think, has
  also lost its pristine sense. By "Tread on a worm and it will turn" is
  usually meant that the very meekest and most helpless persons will, when
  harshly used, turn on their persecutors. But the poor worm does, and can
  do, no such thing. I therefore think that the adage arose at the time
  when <i>worm</i> was inclusive of snake and viper, and that what was
  meant was, that as those that had the power to avenge themselves when
  injured would use it, so people should be cautious how they provoked
  them. I am confirmed in this view by the following passage in the
  <i>Wallenstein's Tod</i> of Schiller, Act II. Sc. 6.:</p>

<h3>CONVOCATION IN THE REIGN OF GEORGE II.</h3>

  <p>One hears it so often repeated, that Convocation was finally
  suppressed in 1717, in consequence of the accusations brought by the
  Lower House against Bishop Hoadley, that it seems worth while noting in
  correction of this, that though no licence from the Crown to make canons
  has ever been granted since that time, yet that Convocation met and sat
  in 1728, and again for some sessions in the spring of 1742, when several
  important subjects were brought before it; among which was the very
  interesting question of curates' stipends, in these words:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"VIIth. That much reproach is brought upon the beneficed, and much
  oppression upon the unbeneficed, clergy, by curates accepting too scanty
  salaries from incumbents."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>and which was really the last subject that was ever brought before
  Convocation. On Jan. 27, 1742, it was unanimously agreed, that "the
  motion made by the Archdeacon of Lincoln concerning ecclesiastical courts
  and clandestine marriages, the qualifications of persons to be admitted
  into holy orders, and the salaries and titles of curates," should be
  "reduced into writing, and the particulars offered to the House at their
  next assembly." But in the next session, on March 5, 1742, the
  Prolocutor, Dr. Lisle, was afraid to go on with the business before the
  House, and after "speaking much of a <i>præmunire</i>," and "echoing and
  reverberating the word from one side of good King Henry's Chapel to the
  other," the whole was let drop; and Convocation was fully consigned to
  the silence and the slumber of a century. The whole of these transactions
  are detailed in a scarce pamphlet, <i>A Letter to the Rev. Dr. Lisle,
  Prolocutor of the Lower House</i>, by the Archdeacon of Lincoln (the
  Venerable G. Reynolds).</p>

  digest of all the readings up to the year 1684. How is it possible to
  carry out his wish farther with any advantage? I should feel particularly
  thankful for a satisfactory reply to the following questions in relation
  to this important subject:&mdash;1. As many copies of the first and other
  folio editions, as well as nearly all the copies of the same quarto
  editions, differ from each other, how are these differences to be
  treated? What copies are to be taken for texts, and how many copies of
  each are to be collated? 2. Are such books as Beckett, Jackson and
  others, to be examined? If not, are <i>any</i> conjectural emendations of
  the last and present centuries to be given? Where is the line to be
  drawn? A mere selection is valueless, or next to valueless; because,
  setting aside the differences in opinion in such matters, we want to know
  what conjectures are new, and which are old? 3. Are the various readings
  suggested in periodicals to be given? 4. Can any positive and practical
  rules be furnished, likely to render such an undertaking useful and
  successful?</p>

  correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that Pepys, writing his <i>Diary</i> in
  short-hand, used one and the same character for all the persons of the
  present tense of <i>do</i>, and that the decypherer did not attend to
  this circumstance. In his letter to Col. Legge (vol. v. p. 296.), Pepys
  writes "His R.&nbsp;H. <i>does</i> think," &amp;c., which in the <i>Diary</i>
  would surely be "His R.&nbsp;H. <i>do</i> think," &amp;c. In a similar way I
  would account for the use of <i>come</i> instead of <i>came</i> in the
  <i>Diary</i>, as there is nothing of the kind in the Letters. Should I be
  right, I may have rendered a slight service to the memory of an able and
  worthy man.</p>

  <p><i>To grab.</i>&mdash;A very popular writer has lately rightly
  denounced the use of this word as a vulgarism. Like many other
  monosyllables used by our working classes, it may plead antiquity in
  extenuation of its vulgarity. It has been derived from the Welsh word
  <i>grabiaw</i>, to grasp, and in ancient times was one of our "household
  words." The retention by a tailor of a portion of the cloth delivered to
  him, although it had been a usage from time immemorial, might have been
  considered by our forefathers as a <i>grabbage</i>: we now call it
  <i>cabbage</i>.</p>

  <p><i>The Natural History of Balmoral.</i>&mdash;Dr. William
  Macgillivray, Professor of Civil and Natural History in the Marischal
  College of Aberdeen, and who died there Sept. 5, 1852, left an
  unpublished MS. on "The Natural History of Balmoral and its
  Neighbourhood." This work has been purchased from his executors by His
  Royal Highness Prince Albert; and is to be printed for the use of Her
  Majesty and the Royal Family, and for circulation among their august
  relatives. It was the last work on which the distinguished author was
  engaged, and was only completed a short time previous to his death. It
  also contains some curious speculations regarding several plants and
  herbs of that Alpine district, and their uses in a medicinal and domestic
  point of view, as known to the ancient Caledonians and Picts. Altogether
  it is a most interesting work.</p>

  <p><i>Shirt Collars.</i>&mdash;In Hone's <i>Every-day Book</i>, vol. ii.
  p. 381., I find the following, which I think is after the present
  ridiculous fashion of wearing shirt collars, viz. so tight round the
  neck, and so stiff, that it is a wonder there are not some serious
  accidents.</p>

  <p>These collars, at present worn by the fast young men of the day, are
  called "The Piccadilly three-folds." Now, if this goes on until they get
  to a "nail in depth, and stiffened with yellow starch, and <i>double
  wired</i>," I think it will only be proper to put a heavy tax upon
  them.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Piccadilly.</i>&mdash;The picadil was the round hem, or the piece
  set about the edge or skirt of a garment, whether at top or bottom; also
  a kind of <i>stiff collar</i>, made in fashion of a band, that went about
  the neck and round about the shoulders: hence the term 'wooden
  piccadilloes' (meaning the pillory) in <i>Hudibras</i>; and see Nares'
  <i>Glossary</i>, and Blount's <i>Glossographia</i>. At the time that
  ruffs and picadils were much in fashion, there was a celebrated ordinary
  near St. James's, called <i>Piccadilly</i>: because, as some say, it was
  the outmost, or skirt-house, situate at the hem of the town: but it more
  probably took its name from one Higgins, a tailor, who made a fortune by
  picadils, and built this with a few adjoining houses. The name has by a
  few been derived from a much frequented shop for the sale of these
  articles; this probably took its rise from the circumstance of Higgins
  having built houses there, which however were not for selling ruffs; and
  indeed, with the exception of his buildings, the site of the present
  Piccadilly was at that time open country, and quite out of the way of
  trade. At a later period, when Burlington House was built, its noble
  owner chose the situation, then at some distance from the extremity of
  the town, that <i>none might build beyond</i> him. The ruffs formerly
  worn by gentlemen were frequently <i>double wired</i>, and
  <i>stiffened</i> with <i>yellow starch</i>: and the practice was at one
  time carried to such an excess, that they were limited by Queen Elizabeth
  '<i>to a nayle of a yeard in depth</i>.' In the time of James I., they
  still continued of a preposterous size: so that, previous to the visit
  made by that monarch to Cambridge in 1615, the Vice-chancellor of the
  University thought fit to issue an order, prohibiting 'the fearful
  enormity and excess of apparel seen in all degrees, as, namely,
  <i>strange piccadilloes</i>, vast bands, huge cuffs, shoe roses, tufts,
  locks, and tops of hair, unbeseeming that modesty and carriage of
  students in so renowned a university.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is scarcely to be supposed that the ladies were deficient in the
  size of their ruffs, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>I must conclude this in the words of the immortal poet:</p>

  <p>[Tanner states, the house was called Thorneton Curteis, and
  Torrington. It was founded by William le Gros, Earl of Albemarle, and
  Lord of Holderness, about the year 1139, for Austin Canons, and was
  dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Dugdale says, that when first founded it
  was a priory, and the monks were introduced from the monastery of
  Kirkham; but was changed into an abbey by Pope Eugenius III., <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1148. Though Henry VIII. suppressed the Abbey,
  he reserved the greater part of the lands to endow a college, which he
  erected in its room, for a dean and prebendaries, to the honour of the
  Holy and Undivided Trinity. From the remains it must have been a
  magnificent building. Originally it consisted of an extensive quadrangle,
  surrounded by a deep ditch, with high ramparts, and built in a style
  adapted for occasional defence. To the east of the gateway are the
  remains of the abbey church. The chapter-house, part of which is
  standing, was of an octangular shape, and highly decorated. On the south
  of the ruins of the church is a building, now occupied as a farm-house,
  which formerly was the residence of the abbots. It was afterwards the
  seat of Edward <!-- Page 470 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  of Sir William Wentworth, brother to the unfortunate Earl of Strafford.
  The estate was purchased from one of the Skinner family by Sir Richard
  Sutton, Bart.; it is now in the possession of Lord Yarborough. In taking
  down a wall in the ruins of the abbey, a human skeleton was found, with a
  table, a book, and a candle-stick. It is supposed to have been the
  remains of the fourteenth abbot, who, it is stated, was for some crime
  sentenced to be immured&mdash;a mode of capital punishment not uncommon
  in monasteries. Four views of the abbey are given in Allen's <i>History

  <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, thus notices this derivation: "The
  generally received opinion among alchymistical writers was, that
  chemistry originated in Egypt; and the honour of the invention has been
  unanimously conferred on Hermes Trismegistus. He is by some supposed to
  be the same person with Chanaan, the son of Ham, whose son Mizraim first
  occupied and peopled Egypt. Plutarch informs us that Egypt was sometimes
  called <i>Chemia</i>: this name is supposed to be derived from Chanaan.
  Hence it was inferred that Chanaan was the inventor of <i>chemistry</i>,
  to which he affixed his own name. Whether the Hermes of the Greeks was
  Chanaan, or his son Mizraim, it is impossible to decide; but to Hermes is
  assigned the invention of <i>chemistry</i>, or <i>the art of making
  gold</i>, by almost the unanimous consent of the adepts." Dr. Webster
  says, "The orthography of this word has undergone changes through a mere
  ignorance of its origin, than which nothing can be more obvious. It is
  the Arabic <i>kimia</i>, the occult art or science, from <i>kamai</i>, to
  conceal. This was originally the art or science now called alchemy; the
  art of converting baser metals into gold." Webster says the correct
  orthography is <i>chimistry</i>.]</p>

  <p><i>Burning for Witchcraft.</i>&mdash;When and where was the last
  person burned to death for witchcraft in England?</p>

  <p class="author">W. R.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[We believe the last case of burning for witchcraft was at Bury St.
  Edmunds in 1664, tried by Sir Matthew Hale, although some accounts state
  that the victims, Amy Duny and Rose Callender, were executed. In the same
  year Alice Hudson was burnt at York for having received 10<i>s.</i> at a
  time from his Satanic majesty. The last case of burning in Scotland was
  in Sutherland, <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1722: the judge was Captain
  David Ross, of Little Dean. At Glarus, in Ireland, a servant girl was
  burnt so late as 1786. The last authenticated instance of the swimming
  ordeal occurred in 1785, and is quoted by Mr. Sternberg from a
  <i>Northampton Mercury</i> of that year:&mdash;"A poor woman named Sarah
  Bradshaw, of Mears Ashby, who was accused of being a witch, in order to
  prove her innocence, submitted to the ignominy of being dipped, when she
  immediately sunk to the bottom of the pond, which was deemed to be an
  incontestable proof that she was no witch!"]</p>

<h3>MILTON'S WIDOW.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vi., p. 596.; Vol. vii., pp. 12. 134. 200. 375.)</p>

  <p>It may be worth recording, that among the MS. papers of the late James
  Boswell, which were I believe sold by auction by Messrs. Sotheby and Co.,
  there was the office copy and probate of the will of Milton's widow. She
  was described as Elizabeth Milton of Namptwich, widow; and it was dated
  the 27th of August, 1727. In the will she bequeathed all her effects,
  after the payment of her debts, to be divided between her nieces and
  nephews in Namptwich; and named as her executors, Samuel Acton and John
  Allcock, Esqs. Probate was granted to John Allcock, October 10, 1727.</p>

  <p>Beside this, there was a bond or acquittance, dated 1680 from Richard
  Mynshull, described of Wistaston in Cheshire, frame-work knitter, for
  100<i>l</i>. received of Mrs. Elizabeth Milton in consideration of a
  transfer to her of a lease for lives, or ninety-nine years, of a messuage
  at Brindley in Cheshire, held under Sir Thomas Wilbraham.</p>

  <p>There were also receipts or releases from Milton's three daughters,
  Anne Milton, Mary Milton, and Deborah Clarke (to the last of which
  Abraham Clarke was a party): the first two dated Feb. 22, 1674; the last,
  March 27 in the same year; for 100<i>l.</i> each, received of Elizabeth
  Milton their step-mother in consideration of their shares of their
  father's estate. The sums were, with the consent of Christopher Milton
  and Richard Powell, both described of the Inner Temple, to be disposed of
  in the purchase of rent-charges or annuities for the benefit of the said
  daughters.</p>

  <p>Two of these documents appear to be now in the possession of your
  correspondents <span class="sc">Mr. Marsh</span> and <span class="sc">Mr.
  Hughes</span>; but I have met with no mention hitherto of the destination
  of the others.</p>

  <p>These may seem trifling minutiæ to notice, but nothing can fairly be
  considered unimportant which may lead to the elucidation of the domestic
  history of Milton.</p>

<h3>OATHS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 364.)</p>

  <p>There can be no doubt that, as your correspondent suggests, the
  judicial oath was originally taken without kissing the book, but with the
  form of laying the right hand upon it; and, moreover that this custom is
  of Pagan origin. Amongst the Greeks, oaths were frequently accompanied by
  sacrifice; and it was the custom to lay the hands upon the victim, or
  upon the altar, thereby calling to witness the deity by whom the oath was
  sworn. So Juvenal, <i>Sat.</i> <span class="scac">XIV</span>. 218.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Falsus erit testis, vendet perjuria summa</p>
      <p>Exigua, et Cereris tangens aramque pedemque."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Christians under the later Roman emperors adopted from the Greeks a
  similar ceremony. In the well-known case of Omychund <i>v.</i> Barker,
  heard in Michaelmas Term, 1744, and reported in 1 Atk. 27., the
  Solicitor-General quoted a passage from Selden, which gives us some
  information on this point:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Mittimus hic, principibus Christianis, ut ex historiis satis obviis
  liquet, solennia fuisse et peculiaria juramenta, ut per vultum sancti
  Lucæ, per pedem Christi, per sanctum hunc vel illum, ejusmodi alia nimis
  crebra: <i>Inolevit hero tandem, ut quemadmodum Pagani sacris ac
  mysteriis aliquo suis aut tactis aut præsentibus jurare solebant, ita
  solenniora Christianorum juramenta fierent, aut tactis sacrosanctis
  evangeliis, aut inspectis, aut in eorum præsentia manu ad pectus amota,
  sublata aut protensa</i>; atque is corporaliter seu personaliter
  juramentum præstari dictum est, ut ab juramentis per epistolam, aut in
  scriptis solummodo præstitis distingueretur, inde in vulgi passim
  ore."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Lord Coke tells us, in the passage quoted at p. 364., that this was
  called the corporal oath, because the witness "toucheth with his hand
  some part of the Holy Scripture;" but the better opinion seems to be,
  that it was so called from the ancient custom of laying the hands upon
  the <i>corporale</i>, or cloth which covered the sacred elements, by
  which the most solemn oath was taken in Popish times.</p>

  <p>As to the form of kissing the book, I am inclined to think that it is
  not of earlier date than the latter part of the sixteenth century, and
  that it was first prescribed as part of the ceremony of taking the oaths
  of allegiance and supremacy. In the <i>Harl. Misc.</i>, vol. vi. p. 282.
  (edit. 1810), is an account of the trial of Margaret Fell and George Fox,
  for refusing to take the oath of allegiance, followed by "An Answer to
  Bishop Lancelot Andrewe's Sermon concerning Swearing." At p 298., Fox
  brings forward instances of conscientious scruples among Christians in
  former times, respecting the taking of oaths. He says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Did not the Pope, when he had got up over the churches, give forth
  both oath and curse, with bell, <!-- Page 472 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page472"></a>{472}</span>book, and candle? And was not the ceremony
  of his oath, to lay three fingers a-top of the book, to signify the
  Trinity; and two fingers under the book, to signify damnation of body and
  soul if they sware falsely? And was not there a great number of people
  that would not swear, and suffered great persecution, as read the <i>Book
  of Martyrs</i> but to Bonner's days? And it is little above an hundred
  years since the Protestants got up; and they gave forth the oath of
  allegiance, and the oath of supremacy: the one was to deny the Pope's
  supremacy, and the other to acknowledge the kings of England; <i>so we
  need not tell to you of their form, and show you the ceremony of the
  oath; it saith</i>, '<i>Kiss the book</i>;' and the book saith 'Kiss the
  Son,' which saith 'Swear not at all.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Still the laying of the hand on the book seems to have been an
  essential form; for, during the trial, when the oath was offered to
  Margaret Fell, "the clerk held out the book, and bid her pull off her
  glove, and lay her hand on the book" (<i>H.&nbsp;M.</i>, p. 285.). And
  directly after, when the oath had been read to Fox, the following scene
  is described:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"'Give him the book,' <i>said they</i>; and so a man that stood by him
  held up the book, and said, 'Lay your hand on the book.'</p>

  <p>"<i>Geo. Fox.</i> 'Give me the book in my hand.' Which set them all
  a-gazing, and as in hope he would have sworn."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And it appears from the case of Omychund v. Barker, that, at that
  time, the usual form was by laying the right hand on the book, and
  kissing it afterwards (1 Atk. 42.). It seems not improbable that Paley's
  suggestion, in his <i>Moral Philosophy</i>, vol. i. p. 192. (10th edit.),
  may be correct. He says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The kiss seems rather an act of reverence to the contents of the
  book, as, in the Popish ritual, the priest kisses the gospel before he
  reads it, than any part of the oath."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Query respecting the Welsh custom I must leave to those who are
  better informed respecting the judicial forms of that country; merely
  suggesting whether the practice alluded to by your correspondent may not
  originally have had a meaning similar to that of the three fingers on the
  book, and two under, as described by Fox in the passage above quoted.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Erica.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Warwick.</p>

  <p>In the bailiwick of Guernsey the person sworn lifts his right hand,
  and the presiding judge, who administers the oath, says "Vous jurez par
  la foi et le serment que vous devez à Dieu que," &amp;c. Oaths of office,
  however, are taken on the Gospels, and are read to the person swearing by
  the greffier, or clerk of the court. The reason of this difference may be
  accounted for by the fact that the official oaths, as they now exist,
  appear to have been drawn up about the beginning of the reign of James
  I., and that in all probability the form was enjoined by the superior
  authority of the Privy Council.</p>

  <p>Which of the two forms was generally used before the Reformation, I
  have not been able to discover; but in an account of the laws,
  privileges, and customs of the island, taken by way of inquisition in the
  year 1331, but more fully completed and approved in the year 1441, it
  appears that the juries of the several parishes were sworn "sur Sainctes
  Evangiles de Dieu par eulx et par chacun d'eulx corporellement
  touché,"&mdash;"par leurs consciences sur le peril de la dampnation de
  leurs ames."</p>

  <p>I remember to have seen men from some of the Baltic ports, when told
  to lift their right hands to be sworn, double down the ring finger and
  the little finger, as is done by bishops in the Roman Catholic Church
  when giving the benediction.</p>

  <p>In France the person making oath lifts his right hand. The oath is
  administered by the presiding judge without any reference to the Deity,
  but the person who swears is required to answer "Je le jure." I observed
  that in Britanny, when the person sworn was ignorant of the French
  language, the answer was "Va Doué," which, I believe, means in the Breton
  dialect, "By God."</p>

  <p>In the Ecclesiastical Court of Guernsey I have seen the book presented
  to the person swearing open at one of the Gospels; but in the Royal Court
  the book is put into the right hand of the party making oath, shut. In
  either case it is required that the book should be kissed.</p>

<h3>COMMINATORY INSCRIPTIONS IN BOOKS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 64. 153.)</p>

  <p>Many inscriptions, comminatory or exhortatory, written in books and
  directed to readers, have been commemorated in "N. &amp; Q." Towards the
  beginning of the present century, the most common epigram of the kind in
  the French public schools was the following elegant motto, with its
  accompanying illustration:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Aspice <i>Pierrot</i> pendu,</p>
      <p>Quota librum n'a pas rendu!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Poor Pierrot is exhibited in a state of suspension, as hanging from
  the inverted letter L (<span class="scac"><span
  class="grk">&Gamma;</span></span>), which symbolises the fatal tree.
  Comminatory and exhortatory cautions not to soil, spoil, or tear books
  and MSS. occur so frequently in the records of monastic libraries, that a
  whole album could easily be filled with them. The coquettish bishop,
  Venantius Fortunatus, has a distich on the subject. Another learned Goth,
  Theud-wulf, or Theodulfus, Charlemagne's <i>Missus dominicus</i>, <!--
  Page 473 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page473"></a>{473}</span>recommends readers a proper ablution of
  their hands before turning the consecrated leaves:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Utere me, lector, mentisque in sede locato;</p>
      <p>Cumque librum petis hinc, sit tibi <i>lota</i> manus!"&mdash;<i>Saith Library.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Less lenient are the imprecations commemorated by Don Martenne and
  Wanley. The one inscribed on the blank leaf of a Sacramentary of the
  ninth century is to the following effect:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Si quis eum (librum) de monasterio aliquo ingenio non redditurus,
  abstraxerit, cum Juda proditore, Annâ et Caïphâ, portionem æternæ
  damnationis accipiat. Amen! Amen! Fiat! fiat!"&mdash;<i>Voyage
  Littéraire</i>, p. 67.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>That is fierce and fiery, and in very earnest. A MS. of the Bodleian
  bears this other inscription, to the same import:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Liber Sanctæ Mariæ de Ponte Roberti. Qui eum abstulerit aut
  vendiderit ... aut quamlibet ejus partem absciderit, sit anathema
  maranatha."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Canisius, in his <i>Antiquæ Lectiones</i> (<span
  class="scac">I</span>. ii. p. 3. 320.), transcribes another comminatory
  distich, copied from a MS. of the Saint Gall library:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Auferat hunc librum <i>nullus hinc</i>, omne per ævum,</p>
      <p class="i1">Cum Gallo partem quisquis habere cupit!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Such recommendations are now no longer in use, and seem rather
  excessive. But whoever has witnessed the extreme carelessness, not to say
  improbity, of some of the readers admitted into the public continental
  libraries, who scruple not to soil, spoil, and even purloin the most
  precious and rare volumes, feels easily reconciled to the <i>anathema
  maranatha</i> of the ninth and tenth centuries.</p>

<h3>LIVERIES WORN, AND MENIAL SERVICES PERFORMED,
BY GENTLEMEN.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vi., p. 146.)</p>

  <p>However remarkable the conduct of the rustic esquire of Downham may
  appear in the present duly, when he accepted and wore the livery of his
  neighbour the Knight-Baronet of Houghton Tower, it was a Common practice
  for gentlemen of good birth and estate to accept and wear, and even to
  assume without solicitation, upon state occasions, the livery of an
  influential neighbour, friend, or relation, in testimony of respect and
  affection for the giver of the livery.</p>

  <p>Thus it appears in the Diary of Nicholas Assheton that, in 1617, to
  the Court at Mirescough "Cooz Assheton came with his gentlemanlie
  servants as anie was there," and that the retinue of menial servants in
  attendance upon Sir Richard Houghton was graced by the presence of more
  than one country gentleman of good family. Baines, in his <i>History of
  Lancashire</i>, vol. ii. p. 366., also relates concerning Humphrey
  Chetham, that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In 1635 he was nominated to serve the office of sheriff of the
  county, and discharged the duties thereof with great honour, several
  gentlemen of birth and estate attending and wearing his livery at the
  assizes, to testify their respect and affection for him."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Evelyn, in his <i>Diary</i>, gives a similar account of the conduct of
  "divers gentlemen and persons of quality" in the counties of Surrey and
  Sussex:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"1634. My father was appointed sheriff for Surrey and Sussex before
  they were disjoyned. He had 116 servants in liverys, every one livery'd
  in greene sattin doublets. Divers gentlemen and persons of quality waited
  on him in the same garbe and habit, which at that time (when thirty or
  forty was the the usual retinue of the high sheriff) was esteemed a great
  matter. Nor was this out of the least vanity that my father exceeded (who
  was one of the greatest decliners of it); but because he could not refuse
  the civility of his friends and relations, who voluntarily came
  themselves, or sent in their servants."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The practice of assuming the livery of a relation or friend, and of
  permitting servants also to wear it, appears to have existed in England
  in the time of Richard II., and to have had the personal example of this
  sovereign to support it. He seems, however, to have thereby excited the
  disapprobation of many of his spiritual and temporal peers. I produce the
  following passage with some hesitation, because it is by no means certain
  that any one of the liveries thus assumed by Richard was a livery of
  cloth:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="cenhead">"17<sup>th</sup> Richard II. <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1393-4.</p>

  retenue portent et usent mesme la Livere de Coler."&mdash;<i>Rolls of
  Parliament</i>, vol. iii. p. 313.</p>

  <p>"Richard Earl of Arundel, after the commencement of this present
  parliament, said to the King in the presence of the archbishops of
  Canterbury and of York, <!-- Page 474 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page474"></a>{474}</span>the Duke of Gloucester, the Bishops of
  Winchester and Salisbury, the Earl of Warwick, and others....</p>

  <p>"Item. That the King uses to wear the livery of the collar of the Duke
  of Guienne and of Lancaster.</p>

  <p>"Item. That persons of the retinue of the King wear the same
  livery.</p>

  <p>"To which our lord the King then answered to the said earl....</p>

  <p>"That soon after the coming of his said uncle of Guienne, when he came
  from Spain last into England, that himself our lord the King took the
  collar from the neck of the same his uncle and put it on his own neck,
  and said that he vowed to wear and to use it in sign of good love of
  whole heart between them also, as he did the liveries of his other
  uncles.</p>

  <p>"Item (as to the third). Our lord the King said that it was by leave
  from him, and by his wish, that persons of his retinue wear and use the
  same livery of the collar."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This practice of one of our early sovereigns seems to afford a
  precedent for the mode in which divers gentlemen and persons of quality
  voluntarily showed civility towards Richard Evelyn, and for that in which
  several gentlemen of birth and estate testified their respect and
  affection for Humphrey Chetham. Nicholas Assheton also appears to have
  the support of this royal precedent in so far as relates to his accepting
  and wearing the livery of a friend and neighbour; and the custom of his
  day evidently lends its sanction to his forming, upon a state occasion,
  one of the body of menial servants in attendance upon Sir Richard
  Houghton, when he went to meet the king.</p>

  <p>Another passage in the <i>Rolls of Parliament</i> seems to afford a
  respectable civic precedent for the services performed by Nicholas
  Assheton and other liveried gentlemen, when they waited at the lords'
  table at Houghton Tower:</p>

  <p>"To our lord the King and to his Council sheweth Richard de Bettoyne
  of London, that whereas at the coronation of our lord the King that now
  is, he their mayor of London performed the office of butler with three
  hundred and sixty valets clothed of one suit each, bearing in his hand a
  white cup of silver, as other mayors of London have done at the
  coronations of the progenitors of our lord the King, whereof memory
  runneth not, and the fee which appertained to this day's work, that is to
  wit, a cup of gold with the cover, and a ewer of gold enamelled, were
  delivered to him by assent of the Earl of Lancaster, and of the other
  grandees who then there were of the council of our lord the King, by the
  hand of Sire Robert de Wodehouse, and now comes in estreat to the
  viscounts of London out of the Checquer, to cause to take the goods and
  chattels of the said Richard, eighty-nine pounds twelve shillings and
  sixpence, for the fee aforesaid, whereof he prays that remedy be ordained
  to him.</p>

  <p>"And the mayor and citizens of Oxford have, by point of charter, that
  they shall come to London to the coronation, to help the mayor of London
  to serve at the feast, and always have so done. And if it please our lord
  the King and his Council, we will pay willingly the fee, provided that we
  be discharged of the service."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There can be little doubt that the citizens of Oxford bore their own
  travelling expenses; and it seems probable that the citizens of London
  and Oxford bore the cost of the three hundred and sixty suits of clothes
  and three hundred and sixty silver cups; but this is scarcely sufficient
  to account for their willingness to pay a sum of money equivalent to
  about fifteen hundred pounds in the present day, in order to be relieved
  from the honourable service of waiting clothed in uniform, each with a
  silver cup in his hand, helping the Mayor of London to perform the office
  of butler at coronation feasts. However this may be, it is still somewhat
  remarkable that, in the seventeenth century, Nicholas Assheton of
  Downham, Esq., and other gentlemen of Lancashire, upon a less important
  occasion than a coronation feast, dressed in the livery of Sir Richard
  Houghton and voluntarily attended, day after day, at the lords' table at
  Houghton Tower, and served the lords with biscuit, wine, and Jelly.</p>

  <p>The cases of Rex <i>v.</i> Stubbs and Olive <i>v.</i> Ingram,

  that a woman is not exempt from serving the office of overseer of the
  poor, and Olive <i>v.</i> Ingram (2 Str. 1114.), in which it was held

  <p>A few years ago (she may still be so) there was a gentlewoman the
  parish clerk of some church in London; perhaps some of your readers may
  be able to say where: a deputy officiated, excepting occasionally. But
  many such instances have occurred.</p>

  <p>In a note in Prideaux's <i>Directions to Churchwardens</i> (late

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Photographic Exhibition.</i>&mdash;We understand that the
  Photographic Society has made arrangements for an exhibition of
  photographs in the metropolis during the months of January and February
  next. The exhibition will not be confined to the works of native
  photographers, but will comprise specimens of the most eminent foreign
  artists, who have been specially invited to contribute. From the advances
  which have been made in this favourite art, even since the recent
  exhibition in the rooms of the Society of Arts, we may confidently
  anticipate that the display on the present occasion will be one of the
  highest interest.</p>

  <p><i>How much Light is obstructed by a Lens?</i>&mdash;Can any of your
  scientific correspondents furnish me with an approximation to the
  quantity of light which is transmitted through an ordinary double
  achromatic lens, say of Ross, Voightlander, or any other celebrated
  maker?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Lux.</span></p>

  <p><i>Stereoscopic Articles.</i>&mdash;I cannot agree to my opponent's
  assumed amendment (?) (Vol. viii., p. 419.) <i>space</i>, for the simple
  reason that it would be virtually abandoning the whole of the points in
  dispute between us; when farther discussion and more mature
  consideration, only tend to convince me more firmly of the correctness of
  the propositions I have advocated, viz.:</p>

  <p>1st. That circumstances <i>may</i> and <i>do</i> arise in which a
  better result is obtained in producing stereographs, when the chord of
  the angle of generation is more or less than 2½ inches.</p>

  <p>2nd. That the positions of the camera should <i>not</i> be parallel
  but radial.</p>

  <p>I certainly thought that I had, as I intended, expressed the fact that
  I treat the cameras <i>precisely as two eyes</i>, and moreover I still
  contend that they should be so treated; my object being to present to
  each eye <i>exactly such a picture and in such a direction as would be
  presented under certain circumstances</i>. The plane of delineation being
  a flat, instead of a curved surface, has nothing whatever to do with this
  point, because the curves of the retinas are not portions of one curve
  having a common centre, but each having its own centre in the axis of the
  pupil. That a plane surface for receiving the image is not so good as a
  spherical one would be, is not disputed; but this observation applies to
  photographs <i>universally</i>, and is only put up with as the lesser of
  two evils. A plane surface necessarily contracts the field of view to
  such a space as could be cut out of the periphery of a hollow sphere, the
  versed sine of which bears but a small ratio to its chord.</p>

  <p>There is another misunderstanding into which my opponent has fallen,
  viz. the part of the object to be delineated, which should form the
  centre of radiation, is not the most contiguous visible point, but the
  most remote principal point of observation. I perceive that this is the
  case from two illustrations he was kind enough to forward me, being
  stereographs of a <a href="images/tsquare.png"><img
  src="images/tsquare.png" class="middle" style="height:1.5ex"
  alt="T-square" /></a> square, placed with the points of junction towards
  the observer, and the tail receding from him; and in one case the angle
  of the square is made the centre of radiation, and while its distance
  from the camera is only six feet, the points of delineation are no less
  than three feet apart.</p>

  <p>To push an argument to the extreme to test its value, is quite right;
  but this goes far beyond the extreme, if I may be allowed such a very
  Hibernian expression.</p>

  <p>No object, however minute, can be clearly seen if brought nearer to
  the eyes than a certain point, because it will be what is technically
  called out of focus. It is true that this point differs in different
  individuals, but the <i>average distance</i> of healthy vision is 10
  inches. Now, adopting <span class="sc">Mr. Merritt's</span> own standard
  of 2½ inches between the eyes, it is clear that supposing the central
  point had been rightly selected, the distance between the cameras was
  <i>only double</i> what might have been taken an extreme distance. It is
  scarcely necessary to suggest what a person devoid of taste (in which
  category I am no doubt included) might do in producing monstrosities by
  adopting the radial method, as such an one is not very likely to produce
  good results at all.</p>

  <p>I now address myself to another accusation. It is quite true that I am
  unacquainted with the <i>scholastic dogmas</i> of perspective, but
  equally true that I am familiar with <i>the facts</i> thereof, as any one
  must be who has studied optical and geometrical science generally; and
  while I concur in the propositions as enunciated for a one-eyed picture,
  I by no means agree to the assumption that the "vanishing points," in the
  two stereographs taken radially with the necessary precautions, "would be
  so far apart, that they could not in the stereoscope flow into one;" on
  the contrary, direct experiment shows me, what reason also suggests, that
  they do flow into one as <i>completely as in nature when viewed by both
  eyes</i>.</p>

  <p>I put the proposition thus, because I do not hesitate to avow that in
  nature, as interpreted by binocular vision, these points do not
  <i>absolutely</i>, but only approximately, flow <i>into one</i>;
  otherwise one eye would be as effective as two.</p>

  <p>I have not the smallest objection to my views being considered "false
  to art," as, alas! her fidelity to nature is by no means beyond
  suspicion. <!-- Page 477 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page477"></a>{477}</span></p>

  <p>Lastly, as to the model-like appearance of stereographs taken at a
  large angle, for the fact I need only refer the objector to most of the
  beautiful foreign views now so abundant in our opticians' shops: for the
  reason, is it not palpable that increasing the width of the eyes is
  analogous to decreasing the size of the object? and if naturally we
  cannot "perceive at one view three sides of a cake, two heads of a drum,
  nor any other like absurdity," it is only because we do not use objects
  sufficiently <i>small</i> to permit us to do so. Even while I am writing
  this, I have before me a small rectangular inkholder about 1¼ inches
  square, and distant from my eyes about one foot, in which the very absurd
  phenomenon complained of does exist, the front, top, and <i>both</i>
  sides being perfectly visible at once: and being one of those obstinate
  fellows who will persist in judging personally from experience if
  possible, I fear I shall be found incorrigible on the points on which
  your correspondent has so kindly endeavoured to enlighten me.</p>

  <p><i>To introduce Clouds</i> (Vol. viii., p. 451.) as desired by your

  must be treated in the sky by solution of cyanide of potassium laid on in
  the form desired with a camel's hair pencil. This discharges a portion of
  the reduced silver, and allows the light to penetrate; but great care is
  required to stop the action by well washing in water before the process
  has gone too far. White clouds are produced by painting them in with a

<h3>Replies to Minor Queries.</h3>

  <p><i>Death of Edward II.</i> (Vol. viii., p. 387.).&mdash;P. C. S. S.
  has noticed with considerable surprise the very strange assertion of
  <span class="sc">Mr. C.&nbsp;M. Ingleby</span> with reference to the murder of
  Edward II. at Berkeley Castle, viz. that "Echard and Rapin are silent,
  both as to the event and the locality." If <span class="sc">Mr.
  Ingleby</span> will again refer to Echard (vol. i. p. 341., edit. 1718)
  and to Rapin (vol. iii. p. 147., edit. 1749), he will perceive that the
  two historians record "both the event and the locality."</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Ingleby</span> did not perhaps consider that the
  transaction in question took place during the reign of Edward III.; and
  is, therefore, not to be sought for at the close of that of Edward
  <i>II.</i> (where probably <span class="sc">Mr. C.&nbsp;M. Ingleby</span>
  looked for it), but among the occurrences in the time of Edward
  <i>III.</i> <span class="sc">Mr. C.&nbsp;M. Ingleby</span> will assuredly find
  it there, not only in Echard and Rapin, but in every other History of
  England since the date of the "event."</p>

  <p><i>Luther no Iconoclast</i> (Vol. viii., p. 335.).&mdash;An occasional
  contributor wishes the Editor to note down this Query. What could have
  led your correspondent <span class="sc">J.&nbsp;G. Fitch</span> to use so
  peculiarly inappropriate a synonym for Martin Luther as "the great
  Iconoclast?" Has he any historical evidence for Luther's breaking a
  single image?</p>

  <p>It is not to defend Luther, but to point out a defect in his teaching,
  as it is regarded by the adherents of other Protestant churches, that Dr.
  Maclaine has said, in his note on Book <span class="scac">IV</span>. ch.
  i. § 18. of Mosheim:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is evident, from several passages in the writings of Luther, that
  he was by no means averse to the use of images, but that, on the
  contrary, he looked upon them as adapted to excite and animate the
  devotion of the people."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mosheim, and Merle D'Aubigné, and probably any other historian of the
  Reformation in Germany, may be cited as witnesses for the notorious fact,
  that Carlstadt excited the citizens of Wittemberg to break the images in
  their churches when Luther was concealed in the Castle of Wartburg, and
  that he rebuked and checked these proceedings on his return. See Mosheim,
  as cited before, or D'Aubigné, book <span class="scac">IX.</span> ch.

  information he requires.</p>

  <p>This very interesting portrait is now at my brother's, Holland House,
  Kensington.</p>

  <p>My late father, Lord Holland, had a pretty picture of the late Lord
  Hertford's mother (I believe), or some near relation of his. Not being
  connected with that family, my father offered it to Lord Hertford,
  leaving it to his lordship to give him such picture as he might choose in
  exchange. Some time afterwards this portrait of Baretti was sent, and was
  much prized and admired. It represents Baretti reading a small book,
  which he holds close to his face with both hands; he is in a white coat,
  and the whole carries with it a certainty of resemblance. This occurred
  about twenty-five years ago. Perhaps it may interest your readers to
  learn that our distinguished <!-- Page 478 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page478"></a>{478}</span>painter, Watts, painted for my brother,
  Lord Holland, a portrait of another distinguished Italian, Mr. Panizzi,
  and pendant to the former. He is represented leaning forward and writing,
  and the likeness is very striking.</p>

  <p><i>Passage in Sophocles.</i>&mdash;In Vol. viii., p. 73., appears an

  &#x1F01;&rho;&mu;&#x1F79;&zeta;&omega;&nu;</span>, he
  translates,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Whose mind the God leads to destruction; <i>but that he</i> (<i>the
  God</i>) practises this a short time without destroying such an one."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But for the Italics it might have been an oversight: they would seem
  to imply he has some authority for his translation. I have no edition of
  Sophocles by me to discover, but surely no critical scholar can acquiesce
  in it. The only <i>active</i> sense of <span title="prassein" class="grk"
  >&pi;&rho;&#x1F71;&sigma;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;</span> I remember at
  the moment is <i>to exact</i>. It surely should be translated, "<i>And
  he, whom the God so leads to</i> <span title="atê" class="grk"
  >&#x1F04;&tau;&eta;</span>, <i>fares</i> a <i>very</i> short time without
  it." The best translation of <span title="atê" class="grk"
  >&#x1F04;&tau;&eta;</span> is, perhaps, <i>infatuation</i>. Moreover, how
  is the above translation reconciled with the very superlative <span
  title="oligoston" class="grk"
  >&#x1F40;&lambda;&#x1F77;&gamma;&omicron;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&nu;</span>?</p>

  <p><i>Brothers of the same Name</i> (Vol. viii., p. 338.).&mdash;It is
  not unusual in old pedigrees to find two brothers or two sisters with the
  same Christian name; but it is unusual to find more than two living at
  the same time with only one Christian name between them: this, however,
  occurs in the family of Gawdy of Gawdy Hall, Norfolk. Thos. Gawdy married
  three wives, and by each had a son Thomas. The eldest was a
  serjeant-at-law, and died in 1556. The second was a judge of the Queen's
  Bench, and died in November, 1587 or 1588. The third is known as Sir
  Francis Gawdy, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas; but he also was
  baptized by the name of Thomas. Lord Coke, who succeeded him as Chief
  Justice, says (Co. Lit. 3. a.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If a man be baptized by the name of Thomas, and after at his
  confirmation by the bishop he is named John, he may purchase by his name
  of confirmation; and this was the case of Sir Francis Gawdie, late C.&nbsp;J.
  of C.&nbsp;B., whose name of baptism was Thomas, and his name of confirmation
  Francis; and that name of Francis, by the advice of all the judges in
  anno 36 Henry VIII. (1544-5), he did bear and after used in all his
  purchases and grants."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The opportunity afforded by the Roman Catholic Church of thus changing
  the baptismal name may help to account for this practice, which probably
  arose from a desire to continue the particular name in the family. If one
  of two sons with the same name of baptism died in childhood, the other
  continued the name: if both lived, one of them might change his name at
  confirmation. There is no name given at confirmation according to the
  form of the Church of England.</p>

  <p><i>High Dutch and Low Dutch</i> (Vol. viii., p.
  413.).&mdash;Considerable misapprehension appears to have arisen with
  regard to these expressions, from the fact of the German word
  <i>Deutsch</i> being sometimes erroneously understood to mean Dutch. But
  German scholars very well know that in Germany nothing is more common
  than to speak of <i>Hoch Deutsch</i> and <i>Nieder Deutsch</i> (High
  German and Low German), as applied respectively to that language when
  grammatically spoken and correctly pronounced, and to the bad grammar and
  worse pronunciation indulged in by many of the provincials, and also by
  the lower class of people in some of the towns where High German is
  supposed to prevail. Thus, for examples Dresden is regarded as the
  head-quarters of <i>Hoch Deutsch</i>, because there the language is
  spoken and pronounced with the most purity: Berlin, also, as regards the
  well-educated classes, boasts of the <i>Hoch Deutsch</i>; but the common
  people (das Volk) of the Prussian capital indulge in a dialect called
  <i>Nieder Deutsch</i>, and speak and pronounce the language as though
  they were natives of some remote province. Now, the instance of Berlin I
  take to be a striking illustration of the meaning of these expressions,
  as both examples are comprised in the case of this city.</p>

  <p>The German word for "German" is <i>Deutsch</i>; for "Dutch" the German
  is <i>Holländisch</i>; and I presume it is from the similarity of
  <i>Deutsch</i> and <i>Dutch</i> that this common error is so frequently
  committed. For the future let it be remembered, that <i>Dutch</i> is a
  term which has no relation whatever to German; and that "High German" is
  that language spoken and written in its purity, "Low German" all the
  dialects and mispronunciations which do not come up to the standard of
  correctness.</p>

  a 4to. one was published at London in 1689, printed by R. Everingham, and
  sold by R. Bentley and M. Magnes. Prefixed to it is the placet of the
  king, dated 6th October, 1662, with the subsequent approbation of

  uncommon, having passed through several editions. Mine is "à Paris, chez

  addition of a "Traité de la Connoissance des Causes Magnétiques, &amp;c.,

  <p>In the 351st number of the <i>Monthly Magazine</i>, dated March 1st,

  Gloucester, giving several instances of his having successfully used the
  divining-rod for the purpose of discovering water. He says the gift is
  not possessed by more than one in two thousand, and attributes the power
  to electricity. Those persons in whose hands it will work must possess a
  redundancy of that fluid. He also states that metals are discovered by
  the same means.</p>

  <p><i>Slow-worm Superstition</i> (Vol. vii., p. 33.).&mdash;The belief
  that the slow-worm cannot die until sunset prevails in Dorsetshire. In
  the New Forest the same superstition exists with regard to the brown
  adder. Walking in the heathy country between Beaulieu and Christ Church I
  saw a very large snake of this kind, recently beaten to death by the
  peasant boys, and on remarking that the lower jaw continued to move
  convulsively, I was told it would do so "till the moon was up."</p>

  <p>An aged woman, now deceased, who had when young been severely bitten
  by a snake, told me she always felt a severe pain and swelling near where
  the wound had been, on the anniversary of the occurrence. Is this common?
  and can it be accounted for?</p>

  <p><i>Lines on the Institution of the Garter</i> (Vol. viii., p.
  182.).&mdash;A.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;R. says, "as also from the proverbial expression used
  in Scotland, and to be found in Scott's <i>Works</i>, of 'casting a
  leggin girth,' as synonymous with a female 'faux pas.'" I may mention to
  your correspondent (if he is not already aware) that the expression is
  taken from Allan Ramsay's continuation of <i>Christ's Kirk on the
  Green</i> (edit. Leith, 1814, 1 vol. p. 101.):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

      <p class="i1">Lang or I married Tammie."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>and is explained by the author in a note, "Like a tub that loses one
  of its bottom hoops." In the west of Scotland the phrase is now
  restricted to a young woman who has had an illegitimate child, or what is
  more commonly termed "a misfortune," and it is probable never had another
  meaning. <i>Legen</i> or <i>leggen</i> is not understood to have any
  affinity in its etymology to the word <i>leg</i>, but is <i>laggen</i>,
  that part of the staves which projects from the bottom of the barrel, or
  of the child's <i>luggie</i>, out of which he sups his oatmeal
  <i>parritch</i>; and the <i>girth</i>, <i>gird</i>, or hoop, that by
  which the vessel at this particular place is firmest bound together.
  Burns makes a fine and emphatic use of the word <i>laggen</i> in the
  "Birthday Address," in speaking of the "Royal lasses dainty"
  (<i>Cunninghame</i>, edit. 1826, vol. ii. p. 329.):</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p>which means, that at last, whether through pride, hunger, or long

  scraped from the bottom of the <i>coggie</i>, and to its inmost recesses
  surrounded by the <i>laggen girth</i>. Of the motto of the garter, "Honi
  soit qui mal y pense," I have heard a burlesque translation known but to
  few, in "<i>Honeys sweet quo' Mally Spence</i>," synonymous with
  Proverbs, chap. ix. verse 17: "Stolen waters are sweet, and bread

  terrore carentem," in the preceding line, understood the verse in
  question to mean, "which regards length of life as the last of Nature's
  gifts." On reconsideration, however, I do not doubt that the received
  interpretation, which makes <i>spatium extremum</i> equivalent to
  <i>finem</i>, is the correct one.</p>

  <p><i>Heraldic Query</i> (Vol. viii., p. 219.).&mdash;Although A. was
  killed in open rebellion, I think his armorial bearings were not
  forfeited unless he was subsequently attainted by act of parliament; and
  even in that case it is possible that the act contained a provision that
  the penalty should not extend to the prejudice of any other person than
  the offender. Assuming that A. was not attainted, or that the
  consequences of his attainder were thus restricted to himself, or that
  his attainder has been reversed, it is clear that his lawful posterity
  are still entitled to his arms, notwithstanding the acceptance by his
  grandson C. of a new grant, which obviously could no more affect the
  title to the ancient arms than the creation of a modern barony can
  destroy the right of its recipient to an older one. The descendants of C.
  being thus entitled to both coats, could, I imagine, without difficulty
  obtain a recognition of their right; and I think they might either use
  the ancient arms alone, or the ancient and the modern arms quarterly,
  precedence being given to the former. The proper course would be to seek
  the licence of the crown for the resumption of the ancient surname, as
  well as of the arms. Such permission would, I apprehend, be now conceded,
  even though it should appear that the arms were really forfeited.</p>

  <p><i>Sir John Vanbrugh</i> (Vol. viii., p. 65. &amp;c.).&mdash;In <i>An
  Account of the Life and Death of Mr. Matthew Henry</i>, published in the
  year 1716, his biographer having related that he was chosen a minister of
  a congregation of Dissenters in the city of Chester, and that he went
  there to reside on the first day of June, 1687, goes on to state (p.
  75.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That city was then very happy in several worthy gentlemen that had
  habitations there; they were not altogether strangers to Mr. Henry before

  father to Sir John Vanbrugh, were in communion with the Church of
  England, but they heard Mr. Henry on the week-day lectures, and always
  treated him with great and serious respect."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This evidence serves to show that a Mr. Vanbrugh, who was living in
  Chester in 1687, was the father of Sir John Vanbrugh. I have been told
  that in former times there was a sugar-bakery at Chester. Did the father
  of Sir John Vanbrugh carry on that business at Chester during any period

<h2>Notices to Correspondents.</h2>

  <p><i>We beg to call the special attention of such of our readers as are
  Autograph Collectors to the advertisement which appears in the present
  Number, descriptive of certain family and historical papers, which have
  been missed within the last twelve months from the proper custody, and
  shall only be too glad to hear that by so doing we have at all
  contributed to their recovery.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Wanted</span>. <i>So many of our Correspondents
  seem disposed to avail themselves of our plan of placing the booksellers
  in direct communication with them, that we find ourselves compelled to
  limit each list of books to two insertions. We would also express a hope
  that those gentlemen who may at once succeed in obtaining any desired
  volumes will be good enough to notify the same to us, in order that such
  books may not unnecessarily appear in such list even a second
  time.</i></p>

  <p>"This light and pleasant Farina is one of the most excellent,

  kinds of medicines. It is particularly useful in confined habit of body,
  as also diarrh&oelig;a, bowel complaints, affections of the kidneys and
  bladder, such as stone or gravel; inflammatory irritation and cramp of
  the urethra, cramp of the kidneys and bladder, strictures, and
  hemorrhoids. This really invaluable remedy is employed with the most
  satisfactory result, not only in bronchial and pulmonary complaints,
  where irritation and pain are to be removed, but also in pulmonary and
  bronchial consumption, in which it counteracts effectually the
  troublesome cough; and I am enabled with perfect truth to express the
